# Examples

This folder contains a number of examples of potential use cases of the Dagster Cloud CI/CD Action.

- [`minimal`](./minimal): A minimal example which builds a single code location from a Dockerfile.
- [`requirements-txt`](./requirements-txt): A lightweight example which builds from a `requirements.txt`
file instead of a Dockerfile.
- [`multiple-locations`](./multiple-locations): An example containing multiple code locations,
which are built and pushed separately.
