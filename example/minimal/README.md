# Minimal Example

This is a minimal example of a repo set up to use the CI Action. The [`locations.yaml`](./locations.yaml) file
specifies to build the `github_action_demo_minimal` code location using the Dockerfile in the current
directory, using `repo.py` as an entry point.

The GitHub actions workflow for this example can be found at
[`.github/workflows/example-minimal.yml`](../../.github/workflows/example-minimal.yml).
